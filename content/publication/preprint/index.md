abstract: E-commerce platforms support the needs and livelihoods of their two most important stakeholders – customers and producers / sellers. Multiple algorithmic systems mediate the interactions between these stakeholders by connecting customers to producers with relevant items. For example, search systems deployed on these platforms rank the products (thereby their sellers) on the basis of their relevance to the search query provided by the customer. The search results on these platforms feature advertised / sponsored results interleaved with organic results that are selected based on customer behavior signals. Recently, policymakers and third-party sellers of the platforms have raised concerns regarding the fairness of these algorithms. These concerns are centered primarily around the vertical integration of e-commerce platforms in various facets of the marketplace like manufacture and promotion of private label (PL) products. The issues have been well covered in the popular press too; however most of these coverages have been speculative and anecdotal. In this paper, we develop a simple but effective framework for systematically quantifying the extent of PL product promotion on e-commerce search results. We utilise this framework to audit the search results on Amazon.in and Flipkart, two of the largest e-commerce platforms operating in India. By analysing 2600 snapshots of search results across the two platforms, we discover that Amazon significantly promotes more PLs on the advertised positions than Flipkart. Importantly, while Amazon has claimed on-record that they promote only 2-3% of their PL products, the actual number is far higher at 10.75% as per our dataset. Both platforms use different strategies to promote their PL products, such as placing more PLs on the advertised positions – while Amazon places them on the first, middle and last rows of the search results, Flipkart places them on the first two positions and the last column of the search results. Finally to supplement the findings from the collected data, we conducted a survey among 125 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The click pattern from our survey shows that users strongly prefer to click on products placed at positions that correspond to the PL products on the search results of Amazon and Flipkart. Finally, we also discover that Amazon’s PL promotion strategy has significantly more nudging prowess than that of Flipkart. We conclude with a call to action for community members, platforms, and policymakers for better governance of competition on e-commerce platforms.
