• Developed a Sports statistics system, which would provide the respective sports statistics for the SPARQL query the user puts.

• Extracted data from various websites and merged the data into respective categories.

• Created a federated ontology using Prot ́eg ́e in a combination of both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

• Created Semantic mappings for every attribute and loaded the data into an RDF triple store.
