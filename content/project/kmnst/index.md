• Enhanced accuracy by 2% by using stance classification from ‘Multi-task Learning for Rumor Verification’ in
‘Going Beyond Content Richness: Verified Information Aware Summarization of Crisis-Related Microblogs’ Tree
LSTM-based rumor detection.

• Processed the PHEME9 data set for both top-down and bottom-up approaches to suit ‘Rumor Detection on
Twitter with Tree-structured Recursive Neural Networks’ model.
